- Provides granular control of user access to services and resources.

- Integrated into most AWS services, allowing to define access controls in one place. 

- Analyses continuous streams of metadata generated in the account and network activity from 
    - CloudTrail events
    - VPC flow logs
    - DNS logs

- Uses integrated threat intelligence (ie. known malicious IPs), anomaly detection, and machine learning to identify threats
